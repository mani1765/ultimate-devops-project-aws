# EKS Cluster Resources Description and Purpose

## 1. S3 Backend Configuration
- **Resources**: S3 Bucket, DynamoDB Table
- **Purpose**: 
  - The S3 bucket is used to store the Terraform state file, which keeps track of the resources managed by Terraform.
  - The DynamoDB table is used to manage state locking, preventing concurrent modifications to the state file.

## 2. AWS Provider
- **Resources**: AWS Provider Configuration
- **Purpose**: 
  - The AWS provider configuration specifies the AWS region where the resources will be created.

## 3. VPC Configuration
- **Resources**: VPC
- **Purpose**: 
  - The VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) provides an isolated network environment for the EKS cluster.

## 4. Private Subnets
- **Resources**: Private Subnets
- **Purpose**: 
  - Private subnets are used to host the EKS nodes, ensuring that they are not directly accessible from the public internet.

## 5. Public Subnets
- **Resources**: Public Subnets
- **Purpose**: 
  - Public subnets are used to host the NAT gateways and can be used for other public-facing resources if needed.

## 6. Internet Gateway
- **Resources**: Internet Gateway
- **Purpose**: 
  - The Internet Gateway allows resources within the VPC to communicate with the public internet.

## 7. Elastic IPs for NAT Gateways
- **Resources**: Elastic IPs (EIPs)
- **Purpose**: 
  - Elastic IPs are used to provide static public IP addresses for the NAT gateways.

## 8. NAT Gateways
- **Resources**: NAT Gateways
- **Purpose**: 
  - NAT Gateways enable instances in the private subnets to connect to the internet while remaining inaccessible from the public internet.

## 9. Public Route Table
- **Resources**: Public Route Table
- **Purpose**: 
  - The public route table directs internet-bound traffic from the public subnets to the internet gateway.

## 10. Private Route Tables
- **Resources**: Private Route Tables
- **Purpose**: 
  - Private route tables direct internet-bound traffic from the private subnets to the NAT gateways.

## 11. Private Route Table Associations
- **Resources**: Private Route Table Associations
- **Purpose**: 
  - These associations link the private route tables to the private subnets.

## 12. Public Route Table Associations
- **Resources**: Public Route Table Associations
- **Purpose**: 
  - These associations link the public route table to the public subnets.

## 13. IAM Role for EKS Cluster
- **Resources**: IAM Role for EKS Cluster
- **Purpose**: 
  - The IAM role allows the EKS cluster to interact with other AWS services.

## 14. IAM Role Policy Attachment for EKS Cluster
- **Resources**: IAM Role Policy Attachment
- **Purpose**: 
  - The policy attachment grants the necessary permissions to the IAM role for the EKS cluster.

## 15. EKS Cluster
- **Resources**: EKS Cluster
- **Purpose**: 
  - The EKS cluster provides a managed Kubernetes environment for deploying and managing containerized applications.

## 16. IAM Role for EKS Node Group
- **Resources**: IAM Role for EKS Node Group
- **Purpose**: 
  - The IAM role allows the EKS nodes to interact with other AWS services.

## 17. IAM Role Policy Attachments for EKS Node Group
- **Resources**: IAM Role Policy Attachments
- **Purpose**: 
  - The policy attachments grant the necessary permissions to the IAM role for the EKS node group.

## 18. EKS Node Groups
- **Resources**: EKS Node Groups
- **Purpose**: 
  - Node groups are collections of EC2 instances that provide the computational resources for running Kubernetes workloads within the EKS cluster.
